## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Image Classification**: Detect whether an image is real or fake with high accuracy.
- **Explainable AI with Grad-CAM**: Highlights critical regions of the image that influenced the decision.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless usage.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Uses **InceptionResNetV1** pre-trained on **VGGFace2** for robust facial feature detection.
- **Examples Gallery**: Test the system with preloaded examples for quick exploration.
